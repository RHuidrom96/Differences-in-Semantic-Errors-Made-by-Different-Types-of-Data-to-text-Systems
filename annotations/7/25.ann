T1	ADDITION 361 368	Bedford
#1	AnnotatorNotes T1	This sounds like an addition in the output since there is no element of Bedford in the triple that constitutes a location as it is being shown in the verbalisation
T2	OMISSION 413 419	83.210
#2	AnnotatorNotes T2	This is missing a 4 at the end
T3	REPETITION 493 506	83.210 metres
T4	REPETITION 507 522	above sea level
#3	AnnotatorNotes T4	i am adding two repetitions here but it should be one. the platform is not allowing me to select everything as one repetition.
